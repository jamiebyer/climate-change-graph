## Factors Contributing to Climate Change
-----

These graphs plot the global temperature **anomaly** as a function of time. The **temperature anomaly** is the difference between measured global temperature and the average of global temperature between 1880 and 1910. The black "observed" line is the GISS global land and ocean temperature anomaly record, which can be found [here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/). It starts in 1880.

The colored temperature anomaly lines are the modeled estimates of how much each indicated **factor** or "contributor" affects the global temperature. Each factor was simulated five times, with different initial conditions; each trace here shows the average of five runs. GISS researchers laid out their historical simulations in detail last year in this [article](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/mi08910y.html).

Variance: All the lines on the plot show the variance from the 1880-1910 average of the parameter.

The graph and writeup is from the [Bloomberg Climate Change graph](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/).

**Note - annotate images and save**: The "Explore" graph includes the option to annotate using lines or circles. Use the "Draw Line" or "Draw Circle" buttons visible between tab labels and the graph itself. Also text entered in the box below the figure will be reproduced on the image. Save the resulting annotated image using the "Download plot as a png" button (the little camera).
